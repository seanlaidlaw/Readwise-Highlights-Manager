# Usage

The script requires an API access token to access the Readwise API. To avoid hard coding this it looks for an environment variable named `API_TOKEN_READWISE`.
Make sure to set this in your bashrc.

For example:

```{bash}
# obviously not an actual token, just keyboard mashing
# readwise API token can be obtained from:
# https://readwise.io/access_token

export API_TOKEN_READWISE="Token asdfilTisdawoihd92SDxdfji4389KLdf"
```
